When 0 is addedd to the virtual it is pure virtual function.
Sometimes, a function in the base class serves like a placeholder such functions are called do-nothing fun.

pure virtual functions are also called abstract functions.
A pure virtual function is declared in a base class that has no definition relative to the base class
The compiler required each derived class to either define the function or redeclare it as pure virtual function. 
A class defining containing pure virtual function cannot be used to declare any objects of its own. 
Such classes are called abstract classes.
A class with atleast one pure virtual function is called abstract class.



// Abstract class
Abstract class cannot be instantiated.
It can have normal function and variables along with pure virtual function.
Classes inheritint abstract class must implement all pure virtual function or else they will become abstract too.
