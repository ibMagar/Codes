// Object and instance of an class
// constructors cannot be virtual 
// we cannot refer to the constructor address
// an object with constructors cannot be used as a member of the union
// they make implicit call to the operators new and delete when memory allocation is required.
// when a constructor is declared for a class, initialization of the class objects becomes mandatory.
// when a constructor is not declared in a class, automatically compiler creates an implicit default constructor.
// If a default constructor explicitly returning the program, than the implicit default constructor is overriden
